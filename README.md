## 📌 ** Project Description **  
An automated system for predicting and optimizing the coffee drying process, using sensors that collect important data, paddle beds for moving the coffee, a database, and an AI system to predict timing. Developed by:
- **Mechanical and Sensor Team**: Dessign the mixing system, ensuring even dryness.  
- **Electronic Team**: Sensores (DHT22, flujo de aire) y microcontroladores (Arduino/ESP32).  
- **Software & AI Team**: Design the app to register all the information related to each coffee work on the database. Also, this team will develop an AI system taht will control the machine.

**Current Status**: 🚧 *Active development *.
