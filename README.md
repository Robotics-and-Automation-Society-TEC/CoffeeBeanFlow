## 📌 ** Project Description **  
An automated system for predicting and optimizing the coffee drying process, using sensors that collect important data, paddle beds for moving the coffee, a database, and an AI system to predict timing. Developed by:
- **Mechanical Team**: Dessign the mixing system, ensuring even dryness.  
- **Electronics and Sensor Team**: In charge of sensors, energy and control. 
- **Software & AI Team**: Design the app to register all the information related to each coffee work on the database. Also, this team will develop an AI system taht will control the machine.

**Current Status**: 🚧 *Active development *.
